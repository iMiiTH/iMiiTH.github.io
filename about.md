Hey! I'm Mitchell Mohorovich. I'm currently a 2nd year student at Ryerson University. This blog mostly talks about my attempts and programming and highlighting some useful thing's I've learned that I want to pass along to others. 

My current projects are Forecasted, my first Objective-C application (it shows!), which is a simple weather menubar widget for OS X. Other projects include Bookmarked, which lets you store SSH logins without having to remember any sort of command shortcuts. 

Thanks for reading!
