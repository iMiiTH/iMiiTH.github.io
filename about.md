  Hello! Hi! Hey! Salut! Bonjour! All√¥! My name's Mitchell Mohorovich. 
</p>

I'm a current student at Ryerson University, majoring in Computer Science.

This blog is for my rambling thoughs about my current projects and roadblocks I've experienced along the way, whether that be for school or personal projects. Sometimes there might be something more personal, but probably not. Those are mostly reserved for [@iMiiTH](https://twitter.com/imiith).

I've also released an app onto the app store called Forecasted, and soon to be released on Github, Bookmarked. I hope you've enjoyed anything I've made and I'm always open for feedback and suggestions.
